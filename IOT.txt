To analyze the traffic capture from an IoT network, we can use the Wireshark tool. Follow these steps:

1. Open Wireshark on the "EH Workstation &#8364;" 1" (ParrotSecurity) machine.

2. Go to File > Open and select the traffic capture file from the Documents folder.

3. Once the file is opened, you can start analyzing the packets.

4. In the Wireshark filter bar, enter the following filter to display only the MQTT packets:

mqtt

5. Look for the packet with the "Publish" message. This packet will have a "PUBLISH" label in the MQTT section of the packet details.

6. In the packet details, locate the "Remaining Length" field. This field represents the length of the message in the "Publish" packet.

Please note that the actual value of the "Remaining Length" field may vary depending on the specific traffic capture file. To find the exact value, you can right-click on the field in the packet details and select "Follow TCP Stream" or "Follow UDP Stream" (depending on the protocol used). This will open a new window displaying the message content. The length of this message is the value you are looking for.

Please note that the provided answer is a general guideline and may not be accurate for a specific traffic capture file. To find the exact answer, you will need to follow the steps above and analyze the specific traffic capture file.
